This is our graduation project, it aims to address a key challenge in Artificial Intelligence (AI): building a chatbot that embodies "common sense" in its interactions, allowing it to respond naturally, accurately, and intuitively to user queries. While common sense is a natural aspect of human conversation, it remains elusive in most computer programs, including chatbots. This project seeks to bridge that gap by developing a chatbot system for Student Affairs, capable of understanding natural language, identifying entities, and learning from data using advanced AI techniques.
